# SQL-DBCreation
SQL Projects and Code

Project was completed using MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.

The data dump file works with MySQL but you can use the schema and data insert sections to create a similar DB
in other databases such as SQlite and SQL Server.

The pdf will have the business problem and requirements, along with screenshots of the SQL code, however all the raw code is in the sql file.
